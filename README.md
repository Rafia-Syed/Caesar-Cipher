🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Caesar Cipher Calculator App! 🚀

I’m thrilled to announce the completion of my Caesar Cipher Calculator App, a project that combines my passion for cryptography and Flutter development! This app allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm, with a modern and user-friendly interface.

🔐 What is the Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number down or up the alphabet. My app brings this ancient method to life with a sleek and intuitive design.

✨ Key Features of the App:
✅ Encrypt & Decrypt Text: Easily encode and decode messages with a shift of 3.
✅ Copy to Clipboard: Instantly copy encrypted or decrypted text for seamless sharing.
✅ Beautiful UI: A clean and responsive design built with Flutter.
✅ Cross-Platform: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

💻 Tech Stack Used:

Flutter: For building a beautiful and performant cross-platform UI.

Dart: For implementing the Caesar Cipher logic.

Material Design: For a polished and professional look.

🔧 Challenges & Learnings:
Building this app was a fantastic learning experience! I deepened my understanding of state management, UI/UX design, and Flutter widgets. I also learned how to handle user input dynamically and provide real-time feedback.

📱 Why This Project?
This app is a testament to my ability to solve real-world problems with code and create tools that are both functional and visually appealing. It’s a small step in my journey to explore the fascinating world of cryptography and mobile development.

🙏 Special Thanks:
A big shoutout to the Flutter community and online resources that helped me bring this project to life!
